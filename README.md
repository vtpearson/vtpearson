## About Me

I have professional experience in modern JavaScript technologies such as React, TypeScript, and Node.js and I have delivered maintainable and well-structured code following Coding Standards and Best Practices.

I'm also passionate about solving challenging problems that others find difficult or impossible. Specifically, I have a unique ability of understanding and translate business requirements into development roadmaps.
 
When it comes to my work, I take a lot of pride in what I do. I always make sure that my clients are satisfied regardless of what it takes to make that happen.
